    "intro": "Initially I was the first Front End Developer to join the digital development team that was to work on the website redesign project. It wasn’t just a simple redesign or rebuild, we were building the new website from scratch using React that would hook into the new and improved API’s provided by the back end team. I was involved in all aspects of the project such as wire framing, UI design, UX requirements & feedback and I also helped build an initial proof of concept which would be the basis of the new front end. I worked alongside the growing development team following Agile best practices to build various components and pages but to also share/learn from others. We pair programmed, completed code reviews, followed TDD & BDD approaches and had a nice CI setup. I worked very closely with the in house designer and was given the flexibility to implement responsive strategies for tablet and mobile when needed.",

I was responsible for delivering and maintaining all development projects for the French Connection group which included several websites for FCUK, FCUS, FCCA and Great Plains. This was especially challenging when deploying updates for the American and Canadian teams which required structured co-ordination to minimize disruption. I mentored a few junior front end developers whilst working there and worked very closely with the content, design and SEO teams. Some of the biggest projects I worked on included the checkout redesign, redeveloping each site for each fashion season and also the redesign of the product and product detail pages.",
