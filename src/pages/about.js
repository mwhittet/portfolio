      I really love what I do and consider it a creative passion. It's helped me
      build a great set of professional and personal skills such as having a
      very good eye for detail (pixel perfect), can balance creative designs
      while maintaining good user usability, managing my projects
      accurately/efficiently and I'm also very easy to get along with.

      I have had the chance to work with many different types of companies and
      teams such as start-ups, agencies and larger enterprises. This has allowed
      me to gain a deep familiarity with the full project life cycle involving
      design, wireframes, POC's and MVP's to delivering international/localised
      websites and applications.

      My experience so far has enabled me to lead front end teams by
      collaborating and managing both the business and development requirements
      whilst ensuring smooth user journeys and interfaces. I also enjoy
      mentoring and developing more junior developers through code reviews, tech
      meetings and knowledge/idea sharing.
